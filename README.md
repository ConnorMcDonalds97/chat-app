# Simple Chat Application

This is my simple chat application to learn full stack development.

Built with React, Redux, Redux-Saga, and Websockets.

**Frontend**: React with Redux for state management, and Redux-Saga for real-time message coordination.  
**Backend**: Node.js WebSocket server for live, bi-directional messaging

I'm currently working to improve this application to further develop my skills

#### What I'm currently working on:  
**Making it look pretty (UX/UI)**
