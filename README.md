# Simple Chat Application

This is my simple chat application to learn full stack development.

Built with React, Redux, Redux-Saga, and Websockets.

**Frontend**: React with Redux for state management, and Redux-Saga for real-time message coordination.  
**Backend**: Node.js WebSocket server for live, bi-directional messaging

I'm currently working to improve this application to further develop my skills

#### What I'm currently working on:  
**Making it look pretty (UX/UI)**

**How to run the app**  
### Ordered
1. On one git bash terminal, cd into the chat directory, and run 'npm start'
2. On another terminal, cd into the server directory, and run 'node app.js'
3. Refresh the page that pops up and it should work.
